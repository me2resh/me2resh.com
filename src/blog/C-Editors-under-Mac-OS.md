hola,i had a problem writing C/C++ code on my new macbook, after some googling, I found some editors that allow me to do that:

- XCode which comes with the original DVD of Mac Os, also can be downloaded from [developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/](http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/) 
- Netbeans 6, and can be downloaded from [http://www.netbeans.org](http://www.netbeans.org)
- EClipse, and you can get it from [http://www.eclipse.org](http://www.eclipse.org)

The last 2 programs above are open source, and they can run on any OS not limited to MAC only and they have a lot of cool plugins.

If anyone of you guys know other programs to code C and C++ under MAC, kindly post it in the comments.
