## Welcome to my vuepress blog

So I have been using wordpress for 12 years now, It was fun. I had my fair amount of joy blogging about my experiences. Lately I started to feel it is not the tool for developers to blog. We are eon different frequencies.

Looking around for new / simple blogging tools, I found vuepress, and after an hour of playing with it, It feels that this is going to be my tool of choice for blogging.

I am giving it a try now, if the experiment goes well, I will be moving my old (still valid) blog posts from the old blog to here. so keep checking if you have interest!
