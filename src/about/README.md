# About Me

I am a software craftsman, tech lead, and relentless pursuer of value and quality.

With over 18 years of engineering experience and a proven track record of designing high-throughput applications, my focus is domain-driven design, cloud-native solutions, event-driven architectures, and serverless architecture design patterns.

I have been writing software professionally since 2004, leading teams since 2009, and working at startups and well-established companies.

As an architect, I can navigate the architecture elevator between the engine room and the penthouse, helping engineers master their craft and create better solutions. I also build quick prototypes to validate ideas while assisting CXOs and IT leaders define their business and teams' strategic direction.
