title: AWS Builders day 2018

I've attended few AWS events in the last couple of years in different countries, yet the best experience I had was in the AWS builders day this December 2018 in London.<!-- more -->

The difference is this time, is I aimed for the workshops, not the sessions. I went for the AI / ML workshops, and it was a good deviation from the type of technologies I use day to day.

The reason I like this experience is that it was some sort of hands-on training, I guess if I had that much information in a session it wouldn’t stick to my mind the way it did when I applied all the examples by hand.

You can find the materials for these workshops in this GitHub repo, [AI_ML_Workshops](https://github.com/me2resh/AI_ML_Workshops), unlike many tutorials these work as expected if you follow all the steps.

Going through the examples you will cover different aws tools like: 
- [aws rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/), 
- [aws lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/)
- [aws ec2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
- [aws s3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
- [amazon machine learning](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/), 
- [aws sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)
- [deep learning AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/amis/)
- [apache MXNet](https://aws.amazon.com/mxnet/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

I hope you will find the material as enjoyable as I did, and if you have any similar resources, please share them in the comments.
