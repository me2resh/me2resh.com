title: How Tech Folks Use AI at Work — Poll & Insights
---
<span dir=rtl><social-share :networks="['email', 'facebook', 'twitter', 'linkedin']" /></span>

On **3 May 2025** I asked my tech network on X:

> “If you work in tech, do you use AI in your job?  
>  Please vote and (if you can) reply with the tools you use.”

<!-- more -->

**682 people voted.**

| Role & Usage | Votes | % of all voters |
|--------------|-------|---------------:|
| **Developer — uses AI** | 572 | **83.9 %** |
| Manager — uses AI | 69 | 10.1 % |
| Developer — *doesn’t* use AI | 28 | 4.1 % |
| Manager — *doesn’t* use AI | 13 | 1.9 % |

### Within each role

* **Developers using AI:** 572 / 600 ⇒ **95 %** (≈ 9 in 10)  
* **Engineering managers using AI:** 69 / 82 ⇒ **84 %** (≈ 8 in 10)

## The big picture
AI is no longer a “nice to have”. **Nine out of ten engineers and eight out of ten engineering managers already rely on it daily.** Only 6 % of voters remain AI‑free.

---

## What tools are hot
From 20 + replies, these names surfaced again and again:

| Category | Popular tools mentioned |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **Coding assistants** | GitHub Copilot, **Cursor**, Claude 3.5 |
| **General chat LLMs** | ChatGPT, **Gemini**, Grok |
| **Low‑/no‑code & agents** | Flutterflow, Retool, **n8n + AI agents** |
| **Docs & meeting notes** | GleanChat, NotebookLM |
| **Code review & PR bots** | GitHub bots, Copilot‑for‑Emacs |
| **Research / brainstorming** | ChatGPT Advanced Data, Gemini |

---

## How people actually use AI
* Rapid POCs and prototyping  
* Explaining unfamiliar code bases  
* Auto‑writing unit tests & configs  
* Drafting & polishing documents and RFCs  
* Summarising meetings and logs  
* Brainstorming solutions before coding  
* “Controlled” self‑paced learning (ask → dig → zoom‑out)

## Why a few still hold back

1. **Trust** — fear of hallucinations or leaking code.  
2. **Habit** — they feel “fast enough” with their current workflow.

Both shrink once teams add guard‑rails (private models, review gates) and run small experiments.

## Two favourite real‑world use‑cases

### Engineering‑manager reply
> 1️⃣ Automating daily workflows in **n8n** (AI Agents + MCP)  
> 2️⃣ Summarising any thread they’re tagged in  
> 3️⃣ Polishing write‑ups  
> 4️⃣ “Controlled learning” at their own pace  
> 5️⃣ Vibe‑coding MVPs for fun

### Engineer reply
> “**Copilot** writes the dull boilerplate, **ChatGPT** explains legacy code. Feels like I got a junior dev + a tutor on demand.”

These show why adoption is so high: AI erases drudge work and unlocks rapid learning — whether you manage people or write code.

---

## My take — *opinion*
*I think AI will soon **fade into the background**, like IDE auto‑complete did years ago. The winning teams will be those that **treat AI as a junior teammate** — review its output, feed it context, let it handle the boring 80 %, and reserve human focus for the tricky 20 %.*

---

## Key takeaway
If you’re **still on the fence**, start small:

1. Pick one boring task (e.g. commit messages).  
2. Test a focused tool (Cursor or Copilot) for a week.  
3. Keep only what measurably saves time.

Chances are, you’ll join the 90 % before month‑end.
